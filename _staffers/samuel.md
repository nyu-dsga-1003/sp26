Hi! I'm currently an adjunct instructor at NYU and final-year PhD student at Columbia, working on topics in machine learning theory. In my free time, I love going to the movies and running.

**Office Hours:** Tuesdays 5:30pm - 6:30pm (after class in CDS 242); Wednesdays 1:00pm - 2:00pm (CDS 242)

**Unstructured Office Hours:** If I'm in my office in CDS 236, I'm usually available to answer questions as well (usually on Tuesdays and Wednesdays). Please drop by and say hello!
