**Update (01/25, 01/28):** Several small updates have been made for clarity to Problem 3 and Problem 4:
Problem 3(c): The previous version of PS1 had a line that said to "remember to divide by $n$" but that isn't necessary to the problem, so we have removed it.

4(c): Previously, there was text in this problem asking you to generate a test set of size 1000
1000, but there was nothing to do with this test set in 4(c). We removed it to avoid confusion.

Problem 4(d): We clarified that the $d$ that you are adjusting in this problem is the one for your design matrix (while keeping $d = 5$ for your true function). We also noted that the "theoretical" behavior you might expect for this question for getting a perfect fit might not be exhibited in your code. That's fine -- you can write a one-sentence conjecture here for why that might be the case (anything is worth credit).

4(e): In this problem, it wasn't explicitly clear how large of an independent test set to draw. We added text guidance to always draw 1000
1000 samples for your independent test set (separately from your training data for different values of n).
