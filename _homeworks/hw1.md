**Update (01/25):** Two small updates have been made for clarity to Problem 4:

4(c): Previously, there was text in this problem asking you to generate a test set of size 1000
1000, but there was nothing to do with this test set in 4(c). We removed it to avoid confusion.

4(e): In this problem, it wasn't explicitly clear how large of an independent test set to draw. We added text guidance to always draw 1000
1000 samples for your independent test set (separately from your training data for different values of n
n).
