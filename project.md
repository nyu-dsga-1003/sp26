# Project Instructions
There will be two tracks to the final project in this course. More details and a rubric
will be provided as the semester progresses:

- **Track 1: Applied ML:** Choose a real-world problem, identify how and why machine learning could be helpful, and find or collect a relevant dataset for the problem. Then, establish reasonable baselines and compare performance of several different ML techniques learned in class.
- **Track 2: Research:** Identify a gap in the literature for an ML topic of interest, and then propose and execute experiments to address the gap. Then, write a NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR-style paper.

In either case, the project will involve forming groups of 2-3 students and writing an 8-page paper on your project.

## Key Dates
- Groups formed for projects: Feb 28th
- Project proposal (~2 pages): March 31st
- Final project submitted: May 8th
