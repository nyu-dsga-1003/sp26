# Homeworks
In this section, we will post the biweekly homeworks for the semester. Check back here for the latest problem set!

{% assign sorted_hw = site.homeworks | sort: 'path' %}
{% for hw in sorted_hw %}
  {{ hw }}
{% endfor %}

# Homework Submission Instructions
Submission for all the problem sets is handled through [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/1215266).  If you have not used Gradescope before, please watch this short video: ["For students: submitting a PDF on the Gradescope website."](https://www.gradescope.com/get_started). A typical problem set will have several multi-part theoretical problems and a single coding problem to exercise the students' ability to implement certain algorithms from scratch. 

**Drop Policy:** The lowest problem set will be dropped for every student.

**Late Policy:** Students will have a total of 6 late days for all assignments. After the late days are used, late homeworks can be accepted for 48 hours after the time it is due, with a 20% penalty. The maximum late days acceptable for each assignment is **two late days**; Gradescope will not accept assignments 48 hours after the due date.

**Submission Format:** All submission will be through Gradescope. At the beginning of the semester, you will be added to the Gradescope roster. To submit an assignment, you will need to:

1. Upload a **single PDF document** containing all the math, code, plots, and exposition required for each problem. You will *not* be uploading the code itself to Gradescope.
2. Begin each problem on a **new page.** 
3. Select appropriate page ranges on Gradescope for each homework problem, as described in the ["For students: submitting a PDF on the Gradescope website."](https://www.gradescope.com/get_started) video. 

It is **strongly encouraged** that you submit your homework PDFs as typesetted with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/about/). [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) is a standard online platform for typesetting LaTeX, a bit like Google Docs. You are welcome to generate your LaTeX submissions however you’d like; we only need your PDF. [Here’s a quick resource to get you up to speed for typesetting in LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes). A standard way to include Python code in your PDF generated by LaTeX is [minted](https://github.com/gpoore/minted). 

Another alternative is to submit your assignments as a Jupyter notebook converted into a PDF. The Markdown portions of
Jupyter notebooks allow you to typeset math as well. As long as the submission is a single PDF file, the source that
generates it is up to you. If you decide to submit this way, please make sure that the only outputs included in your
submission PDF are from code cells that are relevant to the assignment.
